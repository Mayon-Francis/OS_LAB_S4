<h1> OPERATING-SYSTEMS-LAB</h1>

The course aims to offer students a hands-on experience on Operating System concepts using a constructivist approach and problem-oriented learning. Operating systems are the fundamental part of every computing device to run any type of software.

3. System calls of Linux operating system:
	*	fork, exec, getpid, exit, wait, close, stat, opendir, readdir

4. Write programs using the I/O system calls of Linux operating system (open, read, write)

5. Implementation of CPU scheduling algorithms
	* Round Robin 
	* SJF 
	* FCFS
